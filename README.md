### [HumanMaterial](https://humanmateiral.github.io/HumanMateiral/)

HumanMaterial aims to estimate Physically-Based Rendering (PBR) materials from a single human image. It enables the estimation of high-quality PBR materials with class differentiation, including:

- Normal
- Diffuse albedo (Diff.)
- Roughness (Roug.)
- Specular albedo (Spec.)
- Ambient occlusion (AO)
- Subsurface scattering (SSS)
- Depth map (Depth)

all from a single input image. Leveraging these estimated results, our method facilitates realistic applications such as relighting and material editing under a novel environment map. Additionally, we employ gamma correction to enhance the brightness of diffuse albedo, specular albedo, and subsurface scattering, thereby improving visual quality.
